tests:
  # the desc string holds a description of the test, if it exists

  # the atoms dict has the keys:
  #   * tags: tags dict
  #       tags with no equals sign have a value of null in this file
  #       tags with no value after = sign have a value of empty string
  #   * source: source string, without single leading colon
  #   * verb: verb string
  #   * params: params split up as a list
  # if the params key does not exist, assume it is empty
  # if any other keys do no exist, assume they are null
  # a key that is null does not exist or is not specified with the
  #   given input string

  # matches is a list of messages that match
