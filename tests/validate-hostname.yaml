# Use notes: These tests should be used on the server for your host-validating
# code. Clients should accept whatever the server throws their way because
# trying to validate hostnames the server gives you isn't sane -- vhosts
# commonly contain weird chars, and oper masks can omit periods altogether and
# include things like formatting characters.

tests:
  # host is the hostname string

  # valid is whether the name should be considered valid

  # valid hostnames
  - host: "irc.example.com"
    valid: true

  - host: "i.coolguy.net"
    valid: true

  - host: "irc-srv.net.uk"
    valid: true

  - host: "iRC.CooLguY.NeT"
    valid: true

  # valid hostnames with digits
  - host: "gsf.ds342.co.uk"
    valid: true

  - host: "324.net.uk"
    valid: true

  # valid hostnames with international encoding
  - host: "xn--bcher-kva.ch"
    valid: true

  # # this should only validate after being transformed into punycode as above
  # - host: "irc.Bücher.ch"
  #   valid: false

  # invalid hostnames
  - host: "-lol-.net.uk"
    valid: false

  - host: "-lol.net.uk"
    valid: false

  - host: "_irc._sctp.lol.net.uk"
    valid: false

  # technically valid hostnames but not allowed as IRC hostnames (server names or client hostnames)
  - host: "irc"
    valid: false

  - host: "com"
    valid: false

  # empty hostname
  - host: ""
    valid: false
